\section{Introduction}
In an era where data is ubiquitously hailed as the new oil, the dynamics of data generation, collection, and monetization have increasingly become central to the discourse on digital rights, privacy, and economic equity. The burgeoning digital economy, while offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth, has concurrently engendered a landscape where the vast majority of generated data—particularly that which is derived from individual users—becomes the purview of a few dominant corporations. This concentration of data ownership and control not only raises profound privacy concerns but also significantly limits the potential for equitable economic participation by individual data producers. Skyedge emerges as a pioneering solution in this context, aiming to democratize data ownership and monetization through a decentralized, permissioned, and anonymized framework.

The inception of Skyedge is predicated on a critical examination of the existing data economy, which predominantly benefits large corporations that harness user-generated data without providing commensurate value to the data producers themselves. This model of data exploitation is increasingly viewed as untenable, prompting a reevaluation of how data is valued, exchanged, and controlled. Skyedge addresses this paradigm with a novel architectural approach that empowers everyday computer users, enabling them to assert control over their data and engage in its monetization within a secure, transparent, and user-centric ecosystem.

The strategic vision of Skyedge is twofold: firstly, to facilitate a shift in the power dynamics of the data economy, allowing end users to become active participants rather than passive subjects of data commodification; and secondly, to integrate consumer data into the DeFi infrastructure, thereby expanding the utility and value proposition of decentralized finance. By doing so, Skyedge not only champions individual data sovereignty but also catalyzes the convergence of data economy and DeFi, engendering a more inclusive, dynamic, and equitable digital financial landscape.

    \caption{Network Architecture}
    \label{fig:network-architecturel}
\end{figure}

At the core of Skyedge's technical blueprint is its innovative network architecture, which eschews traditional centralized models in favor of a decentralized, Layer 2 solution. This choice is strategic and aims to optimize scalability, reduce transaction costs, and improve overall network efficiency. By leveraging an existing Layer 2 framework, Skyedge positions itself within the broader blockchain ecosystem, benefiting from established security protocols and network efficiencies while focusing its innovations on data monetization and user empowerment.

\paragraph{Skyedge Node} The cornerstone of Skyedge's network architecture is its unified node system. Unlike conventional blockchain networks that may deploy disparate nodes for various functions, Skyedge adopts a holistic node design where each node is capable of performing multiple functions, including data verification, storage, and retrieval. This multifunctional node architecture not only streamlines the network's operation, but also amplifies its robustness and agility. The Skyedge network nodes are incentivized through a dynamic reward mechanism, which is intricately linked to their performance in data verification, the integrity of data storage, and the efficiency of data retrieval processes.

    \label{fig:integration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Skyedge node penalties}
In maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the Skyedge network, it is imperative to have a robust system in place to deter and penalize node misbehavior. The penalty mechanism is designed to ensure that all node operators adhere to the highest standards of network participation, securing the network and safeguarding user data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Slashing Conditions: }If a node is found to be acting maliciously, such as by attempting to manipulate data verification processes, storing data incorrectly, or failing to provide data upon legitimate retrieval requests, a portion of the staked \$SKYE tokens will be slashed. For example, engaging in data manipulation might result in a 5\% slash of the staked tokens, emphasizing the critical nature of data integrity within the network.
    \item \textbf{Downtime Penalties:} To ensure high availability and reliability of the network, nodes are required to maintain a minimum uptime. If a node's downtime exceeds the acceptable threshold (e.g., 95\% uptime over a given period), a percentage of the staked tokens could be deducted as a penalty. For instance, if a node's uptime falls below 95\%, it could face a 2\% reduction in its staked amount to incentivize continuous operation and reliability.
    \item \textbf{Performance-Based Penalties:} Beyond outright malicious behavior or excessive downtime, nodes might also be penalized for suboptimal performance. This includes slow data retrieval times or inaccurate data verification. While these penalties would be less severe than those for malicious actions, they serve to encourage and maintain a high standard of service across the network. For example, consistently underperforming nodes could see a 1\% penalty applied to their staked tokens.
    \item \textbf{Graduated Penalty System:} The penalty system is designed to be graduated, meaning that the severity of the penalty correlates with the severity and frequency of the misconduct. A node's first minor offense might incur a minimal penalty, but repeated or severe infractions would trigger more significant consequences. This system is intended to provide a learning curve and an opportunity for node operators to rectify their behavior before severe penalties are applied.
    \item \textbf{Reinstatement Post-Penalty:} Nodes that have been penalized have a path to reinstatement and redemption. After a penalty has been imposed, node operators can take corrective actions to address the issues that led to the penalty. Once these actions are verified and deemed satisfactory, the node can be reinstated with full functionality, albeit with a probation period during which the node is closely monitored for compliance.
    \item \textbf{Transparent and Fair Adjudication:} All penalty proceedings are transparent and involve a clear, predefined process. This ensures that every node operator understands the potential consequences of various actions and that penalties are applied fairly and consistently across the network.
\end{itemize}

Incorporating these penalty mechanisms reinforces the Skyedge network's resilience and reliability, ensuring that all participants are aligned with the network's goal of providing a secure, efficient, and transparent data economy. These penalties not only serve as deterrents against undesirable behavior but also as tools to educate and guide node operators toward adherence to the network's high standards, thus fostering a robust and trustworthy ecosystem.
